### Uncommons
- Battle Rage (By Tess)-- Adds 10% extra health, and buffs your damage and movement speed every time you get hurt during a round.
- Down?Up? Here (By Tess)-- Gives you the ability to flip your gravity by pressing jump. Will also flip it automaticly if your height doesn't change for too long.
